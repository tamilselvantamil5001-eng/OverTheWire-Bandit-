#level 9

#To login for the next level we want change the directory has bandit7 - bandit8.
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
#password : "4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM"

#Now for the next level to find the password clue is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.


#this file is unreadable except for some strings that have "=" in it. 
#there is a way to use strings, but I will use grep
#to use grep, you will need to use "-a" which can read text files
#so the overall code would be " grep -a == data.txt "

grep -a == data.txt

#the password shows up a couple of times using "="
#but only one that shows a line of text that could be readable
# "FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey "
