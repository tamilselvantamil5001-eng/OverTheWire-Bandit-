#This requires a little bit of shifting letters in encryption
#we have to shift the letters over by 13
#best way to figure this out is ROT13 decoder
#I used rot13.com to figure out the cat data.txt it gave

cat data.txt

#code is " Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh "
#rot13.com says that decoded it is
